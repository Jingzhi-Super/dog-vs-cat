Image classification using keras

Two parts:
1. image: image preprocessing. Divide training set into 4 parts due to computation limits.
2. main_CNN: convolutional neural network.
3. transfer: transfer learning with VGG16 network.
4. 

Result:
0.94343 accuracy on Kaggle test set with transfer learning.
